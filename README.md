# ETL Pipeline with Python

## Overview
This project combines two key aspects: designing an end-to-end Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process for a bicycle store and managing and analyzing data related to an e-commerce platform. The ETL pipeline handles data from various sources, including databases, data lakes, and APIs, and involves data extraction, data quality checks, transformations, and loading into a structured data model for analytics.
